# RenameFiles
Program that asks for a file path and generic file name (ie. "Image") and will name everything in that folder with that tag in ascending order (ie. "Image_00001", "Image_00002", and so forth. This programming uses the built in Arrays.sort() so it does have some cases where it doesn't sort properly.
